# Escalation Rules for TechCorp Customer Success AI

## Purpose
This document outlines the specific conditions under which customer queries should be escalated from the AI customer success agent to human support representatives. These rules ensure that complex, sensitive, or high-risk situations receive appropriate attention.

## Escalation Criteria

### 1. Pricing and Financial Matters
- **Always escalate** any queries related to:
  - Subscription costs, billing disputes, or refunds
  - Contract negotiations or custom pricing
  - Payment processing issues
  - Discount requests or promotional codes

### 2. Sentiment-Based Escalation
- Escalate when sentiment analysis scores fall below **-0.3** (negative sentiment threshold)
- Monitor for expressions of frustration, anger, or dissatisfaction
- Pay attention to urgency indicators (excessive punctuation, capitalization, time-sensitive language)

### 3. Legal Concerns
- Escalate immediately when customers mention:
  - Legal terminology (lawsuit, attorney, cease and desist, etc.)
  - Regulatory compliance issues
  - Data privacy concerns beyond standard GDPR requests
  - Intellectual property matters

### 4. Customer Preference
- Escalate when customers explicitly request to speak with a human
- Honor requests for supervisor or manager consultation
- Respect preferences for human interaction due to accessibility needs

### 5. Unresolved Queries
- Escalate after **3 consecutive exchanges** without satisfactory resolution
- Flag for escalation if the AI cannot provide a definitive answer after multiple attempts
- Escalate if the query requires information not available in the knowledge base

### 6. High-Risk Situations
- Escalate for customers with premium or enterprise accounts
- Immediate escalation for potential security breaches or account compromises
- Issues involving data loss or corruption
- Complaints that could result in negative public reviews or social media posts

### 7. Technical Complexity
- Escalate complex integration issues requiring deep technical knowledge
- Problems with custom configurations or API implementations
- Issues requiring access to backend systems or administrative functions

## Escalation Process

### Automatic Escalation
- System triggers based on keyword detection and sentiment scoring
- Real-time routing to appropriate human support tier
- Preservation of conversation history for continuity

### Manual Escalation
- AI agent discretion for nuanced situations not covered by automated rules
- Supervisor override capability for special circumstances
- Customer opt-out option if they prefer continued AI assistance
